    <tags>myki password manager</tags>
    <summary>MYKI is an offline password manager that securely stores and syncs your sensitive data locally on your MYKI-enabled devices.</summary>
    <description>## Store your passwords offline. Away from the cloud.
MYKI stores your password away from the cloud and allows you to login on any device by pairing your MYKI app with your computer in a P2P encrypted manner.

## Grant login requests from your app.
Pairing the MYKI app with your computer allows you to grant access to accounts in your browser, from your desktop or mobile app.

## No Master Password
You no longer need to create, manage and remember a master password anymore. Use your fingerprint, Face ID or a pin code to access the MYKI app.

## Share access without revealing the password.
MYKI allows you to easily share access to your accounts, credit cards and secure notes without revealing the password.

## Manage your two-factor authentication tokens.
MYKI is also an authenticator that securely stores your 2FA tokens and autofills the codes when you need to login.</description>
